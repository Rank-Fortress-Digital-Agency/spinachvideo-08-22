                            Because explainer videos effectively communicate your message, they’re also great at boosting conversions and sales. One study found that videos on landing pages can increase conversion rates by 80% or more.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And if you’re selling products or services online, you’ll be happy to know that using video on your product pages can increase conversion rates by as much as 35%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, an explainer video is a great place to start if you’re looking for a way to improve your marketing and boost your sales.

                        Adding an explainer video to your website is a great way to engage visitors and give them a quick overview of what you do or offer. Ensure the tape is placed prominently on your homepage and relevant to your target audience.

                <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
                    <li>
                        Use stock footage or illustrations instead of filming your footage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use free or low-cost video editing software like iMovie or Windows Movie Maker.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep your video short – under two minutes is ideal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Focus on delivering one key message in your video.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use a script template to make writing your script more accessible and efficient.
